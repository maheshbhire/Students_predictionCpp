# C++ Machine Learning Project

This project implements several basic machine learning algorithms in C++:

- Logistic Regression (from scratch)
- Decision Tree (from scratch)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) using [mlpack](https://www.mlpack.org/)

---

## Prerequisites

- C++17 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/) (version 3.10 or higher)
- [mlpack](https://www.mlpack.org/) library installed (required for MLP)
- [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) linear algebra library (mlpack dependency)

---

## Setup and Build

### Installing mlpack (Windows via vcpkg)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.gi
